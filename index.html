      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <h3>ðŸ’¼ My Journey</h3>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m Olushola Aileru, a Product Manager & Product Owner with a Masterâ€™s in International Business & Sales Management and over six years of cross-industry experience spanning energy, telecoms, fintech, and the humanitarian sector. I began my career in the finance department of a power generation company, where I developed a strong foundation in coordination, operations, and internal process efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        I later joined MTN Nigeria, where I worked within the sales and distribution divisionâ€”first in the customer acquisition channel, then in the electronic channel. I supported end-to-end device and stakeholder management for SIM registration while ensuring regulatory compliance and optimizing onboarding workflows. In the electronic channel team, I contributed to the sourcing and onboarding of fintech partners into MTNâ€™s digital ecosystem, helping enhance platform capabilities across Mobile Money, USSD, and Sales Apps. I also tracked product performance metrics and supported iterative improvements through cross-functional collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve held direct sales roles with the Finnish Red Cross and currently with MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF), further strengthening my user empathy and stakeholder alignment. Iâ€™ve passed the CIMA Strategic Level exam, equipping me with the financial acumen to align product decisions with business goals and long-term impact.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸš€ Key Experience</h3>
      <p>
        At Product School, I collaborated on the Stay-N-Sleep Loyalty Program, a simulated product solution for the hospitality industry. I contributed to persona development, MVP scoping, and a go-to-market plan designed to boost user retention through a tiered rewards system. At internPulse, I was part of the product team that developed and launched POSPadi, a fintech tool for Nigerian merchants. My contributions spanned idea generation, user interviews, backlog grooming, and sprint collaboration. Additionally, Iâ€™m currently working on Smart Save â€” a personal product concept that automates micro-savings for users in Nigeria. It is a work in progress, focused on building financial discipline through automated deductions, gamification, and behavioral nudges.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸ§  My Approach</h3>
      <p>
        I bring a thoughtful, user-first mindset to product development â€” combining agile delivery, market research, and business insight. Iâ€™m proficient in tools like Jira, Figma, Mixpanel, and Google Analytics, and certified in CSPO, PSPO I & II, and AI for Product Management. I use data and continuous feedback to prioritize value, and Iâ€™m eager to contribute to high-impact, agile teams building meaningful digital solutions â€” especially in fintech, healthtech, or inclusive platforms across the world.
