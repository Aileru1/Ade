      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <h3>💼 My Journey</h3>
      <p>
        I’m Olushola Aileru, a Product Manager & Product Owner with a Master’s in International Business & Sales Management. I bring over five years of experience in Nigeria’s telecommunications industry, where I worked across sales, electronic distribution, and customer acquisition. This foundation gave me deep insight into digital user behavior and business growth strategies. I currently work with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), where I’ve developed strong stakeholder management, communication, and result-driven execution skills. I’ve passed the CIMA certification, which gives me a strong grasp of financial analysis, business modeling, and strategic alignment—essential for product decisions that deliver measurable business value.
      </p>

      <h3>🚀 Key Experience</h3>
      <p>
        At Product School, I collaborated on the Stay-N-Sleep Loyalty Program, a simulated product solution for the hospitality industry. I contributed to persona development, MVP scoping, and a go-to-market plan designed to boost user retention through a tiered rewards system. At internPulse, I was part of the product team that developed and launched POSPadi, a fintech tool for Nigerian merchants. My contributions spanned idea generation, user interviews, backlog grooming, and sprint collaboration. Additionally, I’m currently working on Smart Save — a personal product concept that automates micro-savings for users in Nigeria. It is a work in progress, focused on building financial discipline through automated deductions, gamification, and behavioral nudges.
      </p>

      <h3>🧠 My Approach</h3>
      <p>
        I bring a thoughtful, user-first mindset to product development — combining agile delivery, market research, and business insight. I’m proficient in tools like Jira, Figma, and Google Analytics, and certified in CSPO, PSPO I & II, and AI for Product Management. I use data and continuous feedback to prioritize value, and I’m eager to contribute to high-impact, agile teams building meaningful digital solutions — especially in fintech, healthtech, or inclusive platforms across the world.

        <h3>SLEEP-N-SLEEP Loyalty Program</h3>
        <img src="/Image/Stay-N-SLEEP PICTURE.png" alt="Stay-N-Sleep Loyalty Program" class="work-image">
        <p>
          SLEEP-N-SLEEP Loyalty Program is a tiered rewards initiative designed for hospitality users, including business travelers, leisure guests, and corporate clients. The program offers a points-based system, tiered benefits like Silver Tier perks, and personalized dashboards to enhance user engagement and long-term value.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Product Manager, I led the end-to-end design and launch of the program. I validated the concept through user research and competitive analysis, then translated insights into a detailed PRD and clear MVP scope. I structured a roadmap covering research, development, and post-launch phases, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver backend infrastructure and user-facing features. The go-to-market strategy aligned with business goals, using segmented messaging and value-driven rewards to drive adoption, engagement, and measurable growth.

        <h3>POSPadi</h3>
        <img src="/Image/POS.padi.png" alt="POS-Padi Dashboard" class="work-image">
        <p>
          POSPadi is a fintech solution designed to provide low-cost, intuitive POS services for Nigerian merchants, facilitating everyday financial transactions like bill payments and transfers. I worked alongside the product team to shape a vision grounded in accessibility and inclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through targeted user research and competitive analysis, we validated market need and crafted a roadmap that addressed both technical and user-centric priorities. I focused on defining clear user stories and PRDs, aligning them with achievable sprint goals. Offline support and multilingual capabilities were prioritized based on merchant feedback. Regular syncs with cross-functional teams ensured alignment across design, engineering, and QA. Every phase—from ideation to delivery—was guided by outcome-oriented milestones, ensuring product objectives remained realistic, actionable, and tightly scoped.

        <h3>Sellytics</h3>
        <img src="/Image/Sellytics.png" alt="Sellytics Dashboard" class="work-image">
        <p>
          Sellytics is a performance analytics platform designed to help businesses make data-driven sales decisions. In my role, I led the ongoing refinement of the product backlog, continuously reassessing feature priorities based on evolving user needs and business strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          By analyzing usage patterns, support tickets, and stakeholder input, I identified core areas requiring optimization. I introduced a framework for evaluating backlog items through validation cycles, including user interviews and internal data review. This approach ensured we built what mattered most—features that enhanced usability, delivered insight, and aligned with long-term goals. Collaborating cross-functionally, I facilitated sprint planning sessions anchored in clearly defined outcomes, ensuring continuous delivery of value with measurable impact.

        <h3>SmartSave</h3>
        <img src="/Image/Smartsave.jpeg" alt="SmartSave Logo" class="work-image">
        <p>
          SmartSave is a personal finance idea developed by me to be integrated into MTN Nigeria’s Mobile Money platform. The idea is to help users better manage their finances by tracking expenses, setting savings goals, and getting real-time updates on their budgets.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my original concept, and I’m currently building the website as the first step of the development process. The next phase will focus on setting up the database to support user accounts and backend functionality. SmartSave is an ongoing project, and I’m refining it based on user needs to ensure it’s simple, helpful, and easy to use.
