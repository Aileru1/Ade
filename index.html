      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <h3>My Journey</h3>
      <p>
        I’m Olushola Aileru, a Product Manager & Owner with a Master’s in International Business & Sales Management and a Product Management Certification from Product School. Passionate about creating user-centered digital products, I specialize in fintech and telecom, leveraging market research and data-driven strategies to drive innovation.

      <h3>Key Experience</h3>
      <p>
        At InternPULSE, I contributed to <strong>POSPadi</strong>, a fintech platform for Nigerian merchants.

        <h3>SLEEP-N-SLEEP Loyalty Program</h3>
        <img src="/Image/Stay-N-SLEEP PICTURE.png" alt="Stay-N-Sleep Loyalty Program" class="work-image">
        <p>
          SLEEP-N-SLEEP Loyalty Program is a tiered rewards initiative designed for hospitality users, including business travelers, leisure guests, and corporate clients. The program offers a points-based system, tiered benefits like Silver Tier perks, and personalized dashboards to enhance user engagement and long-term value.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Product Manager, I led the end-to-end design and launch of the program. I validated the concept through user research and competitive analysis, then translated insights into a detailed PRD and clear MVP scope. I structured a roadmap covering research, development, and post-launch phases, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver backend infrastructure and user-facing features. The go-to-market strategy aligned with business goals, using segmented messaging and value-driven rewards to drive adoption, engagement, and measurable growth.

        <img src="/Image/POS.padi.png" alt="POS-Padi Dashboard" class="work-image">
        <p>
          POSPadi is a fintech solution designed to provide low-cost, intuitive POS services for Nigerian merchants, facilitating everyday financial transactions like bill payments and transfers. I worked alongside the product team to shape a vision grounded in accessibility and inclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through targeted user research and competitive analysis, we validated market need and crafted a roadmap that addressed both technical and user-centric priorities. I focused on defining clear user stories and PRDs, aligning them with achievable sprint goals. Offline support and multilingual capabilities were prioritized based on merchant feedback. Regular syncs with cross-functional teams ensured alignment across design, engineering, and QA. Every phase—from ideation to delivery—was guided by outcome-oriented milestones, ensuring product objectives remained realistic, actionable, and tightly scoped.

        <img src="/Image/Sellytics.png" alt="Sellytics Dashboard" class="work-image">
        <p>
          Sellytics is a performance analytics platform designed to help businesses make data-driven sales decisions. In my role, I led the ongoing refinement of the product backlog, continuously reassessing feature priorities based on evolving user needs and business strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          By analyzing usage patterns, support tickets, and stakeholder input, I identified core areas requiring optimization. I introduced a framework for evaluating backlog items through validation cycles, including user interviews and internal data review. This approach ensured we built what mattered most—features that enhanced usability, delivered insight, and aligned with long-term goals. Collaborating cross-functionally, I facilitated sprint planning sessions anchored in clearly defined outcomes, ensuring continuous delivery of value with measurable impact.

        <h3>SmartSave</h3>
        <img src="/Image/Smartsave.jpeg" alt="SmartSave Logo" class="work-image">
        <p>
          SmartSave is a personal finance idea developed by me to be integrated into MTN Nigeria’s Mobile Money platform. The idea is to help users better manage their finances by tracking expenses, setting savings goals, and getting real-time updates on their budgets.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my original concept, and I’m currently building the website as the first step of the development process. The next phase will focus on setting up the database to support user accounts and backend functionality. SmartSave is an ongoing project, and I’m refining it based on user needs to ensure it’s simple, helpful, and easy to use.
